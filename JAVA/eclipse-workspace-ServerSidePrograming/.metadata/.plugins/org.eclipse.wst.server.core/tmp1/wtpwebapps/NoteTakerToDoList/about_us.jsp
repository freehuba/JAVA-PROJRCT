						<p style="margin-left: 300px; margin-top: -190px"> Work in a team to design and code custom-build solutions 
						based on Enterprise Java technologies and related frameworks. Write and execute unit tests necessary to ensure 
						that an application or technical environment meets requirements. Integrate technical and application components.
						Today I don’t teach anymore but I am still passionate about my day to day work: Coding! I love it so much that when
						 people ask me how I can do “the same work” for so many years I always answer that “I have never worked a day in my 
						 life since my work is also my hobby.
						 
						 Being a web developer is something I'm excited about learning because it's a 
						 sector that is always changing and necessitates ongoing education. It's tremendously exciting to be able to use the 
						 newest tools and methods to build practical and engaging websites and applications while also pushing the boundaries 
						 of what the web is capable of.  <p><br><br>
						 <p>
						 Every project offers the opportunity for creative expression, and I find it to be tremendously 
						 fulfilling. Additionally, I have the chance to support organizations and people in their digital activities as a web developer.</p>
